              I'm a product designer and software engineer with over a decade

              that improve creative workflows and teams by making them more
              collaborative, global, and focused on what they do best, creating.

              I have a unique skillset and experience as a designer doubling as
              a software engineer. I have designed and written low-level systems
              such as software build, distribution and packaging systems to
              higher level tooling for creative workflows and UIs for artists.
              This has given me the ability to take a product from conception to
              full deployment and evolution by directly participating the entire
              process from top to bottom; This includes getting my hands dirty
              with code, coordinating infrastruture, strategy and business
              design with leadership, and interacting with users and
              stakeholders to ensure the product is always exactly what they
              need.

              I am responsible for leading a small global team of engineers and
              designers to build and maintain a critical suite of products that
              are used by artists and production teams to share and manage data
              (images, 3D models, files, etc) across the globe. This requires me
              communicate and coordinate with a large number stakeholders to
              ensure our product suite is always meeting the needs of the studio
              and artists.
